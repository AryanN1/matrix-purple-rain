## Purple Matrix Rain

-A simple recreation of the Digital Rain sequence from the Matrix, as demonstrated in a youtube tutorial on the Coding Train

-This is also my first time doing JS animation using P5.js

-Instead of using the japanese font that the matrix uses, I used arabic font, and changed the color to purple

-It's a play on the song Purple Rain by Prince
